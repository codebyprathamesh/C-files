**Description:** This program calculates the factorial of the given number 
**Input:** an integer
**Output:** Its factorial  

**Logic:** 
we know that 0!=1
             1!=1
             2!=1*2       // increase the original value by 1 and then multiply it.
             3!=1*2*3 
declare variable n to store the input number
declare variable i as a counter 
declare variable fact to store the value of the factorial.
multiply all the integers from 1 to n and store it in fact.
